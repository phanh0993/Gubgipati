# Vercel Redeploy Fix

Timestamp: 2025-08-27T13:14:00Z

## Issue Found:
- Vercel returns `DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND` error
- API endpoints return 404 with "deployment could not be found"
- All local testing works perfectly (database, password, API logic)

## Solution:
Force new deployment by committing this file and pushing to trigger Vercel auto-deploy.

## Environment Variables Status:
✅ DATABASE_URL: Correct (tested locally)
✅ JWT_SECRET: july-spa-secret  
✅ NODE_ENV: production
✅ REACT_APP_API_URL: https://julyspa-jfob.vercel.app/api

## Expected After Deploy:
- Login with Ly09/0333109514 should work
- All API endpoints should be accessible
- Dashboard should load properly
